# OVE (Ord. Value Encryption) Alrgorithm

Simple encryption script that gives different output each time. It works by taking ord() func of every element from array and do so more magic 
(details are in the script itself). Decryption is based on bruteforce, but dont worry, script outputs the result 12 times, so the probability of printing 
decrypted text for first time is high. If you dont see any human-readable text after decryption, you have bad luck! jk just run the script again :)

Updated Version: Added Substitution cipher algorithm with absolutely random order of numbers, letters and special chars to input and output when encrypting and its also usable in terminal for faster usage

```Usage: ./ovas.py 1 'test123'```
```Usage: ./ovas.py 2 '0z~($8000$$~()~{){q(0z888{{)q8~(z8~$~(8{z8(qzq0$((~~z8(q)z)qz$$)z(~0'```
